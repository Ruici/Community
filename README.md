# Community

implementing a community detection algorithm using a divisive
hierarchical clustering (Girvan-Newman algorithm). use of 2 python
libraries called networkx and community. The community library will be provided and the networkx is a python library which can be installed on your
machines. 

The assignment will require making use of the betweenness function and the
modularity function which are a part of the networkx and the community libraries respectively.
use the matplotlib library for plotting the communities.

Bonus:
implement your own function to
find the betweenness of the edges and not use any of the library functions to do the same
